<p>LD is a way to express how similar two sequences are. Also called "edit distance," it is the number of single element 
changes (additions, deletions, etc.) that are needed to turn one sequence into the other. 
Strings are the most common sequence type we see in programming, but there are many others. In this demo, we'll stick to strings.</p>

<a id="why-estimate-it" class="anchor" href="#why-estimate-it" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Estimate It When You Could Compute The Real Thing?</h3>

<p>The algorithm for computing LD is quadratic, which means it takes time and space proportional to the product of the length of the two 
strings (or sequences.) 
If you're interested in strings of a few hundred characters, this is not usually a problem because LD will execute in a few tens of microseconds. 
But what if you want to compare pairs of documents or Web pages? 
Executing LD on pairs of 20K strings takes several seconds on a fast computer, and a lot of memory. 
Computing the LD of 50K strings will take many seconds if your computer can do it at all, because the amount of memory required increases at the same rate. 
Documents in the megabytes?  Forget it---computing LD on a pair of one-megabyte files would take hours even if you had the memory.

<a id="what-does-this-heuristic-do" class="anchor" href="#what-does-this-heuristic-do" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What Does This Heuristic Do?</h3>

<p>This heuristic compresses the intput radically (25x to 300X might be typical) and then compares the signatures using LD. 
This time the quadratic space and time complexity work <strong>for</strong> you, because a 150X compression implies a 22,500X speedup. 
You sacrifice some accuracy, but not too much---estimates are typically within about 0.05 of the true value for related documents, 
and somewhat worse for random text. 

</p>

<p>The trick is in the compression. A string--say, a paragraph, compressed by itself, looks much like it does when 
compressed in the middle of a larger document (exactly the same, in fact, except for maybe a few characters at either end.) 
Because of this, the signatures of two versions of a document will tend to also look quite similar, unless the changes
are numerous and fine grained, making the relationship between the LD of the documents and the LD of 
the signatures quite predictable.

A pair of signatures will thus tend to differ in locations proportional to where their pre-images differ.  
For instance, if you compare a document to itself embedded in an HTML page, the signatures will differ mostly at the 
beginning, where the header is, and in at most a few places elsewhere, where formatting tags have been inserted.  

The LD of equal length sequences of randomly chosen text tends to be slightly less than the length of the text
by a rather consistent proportion because a few characters will happen to line up, but most will not. 
This gives a useful benchmark by which related text can be spotted surprisingly accurately.
Even a small divergence of the LD of a pair of signatures thus signals a relationship between documents even
if they have been extensively changed.

For instance, the signatures two translations of Dante's Inferno done a century apart are still recognizably related, as are
the same translation alone, and as part of the three volume set, and moreover, the signatures can be compared
at a rate of several thousand per second. 

</p>

<p>The signatures can also be used to compare documents that are presumed to be similar to see approximately where they differ. Is one signature more or less contained in another? The same will be true of the corresponding documents. Are differences sprinkled throughout? One document is probably an edited version, or perhaps a text document converted to HTML. Etc.</p>

<p>This heuristic is original---some of the incidental code has been cribbed from here or there, and is credited. In particular, the algorithm for computing LD, and the algorithm for computing Shannon Entropy are credited in the code.</p>
