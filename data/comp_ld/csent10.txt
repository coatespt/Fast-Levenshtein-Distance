A FROSTY NIGHT.

   Mother

Alice, dear, what ails you,
  Dazed and white and shaken?
Has the chill night numbed you?
  Is it fright you have taken?

   Alice


Mother, I am very well,
  I felt never better,
Mother, do not hold me so,
  Let me write my letter.

   Mother

Sweet, my dear, what ails you?

   Alice

No, but I am well;
The night was cold and frosty,
There's no more to tell.

   Mother

Ay, the night was frosty,
  Coldly gaped the moon,
Yet the birds seemed twittering
  Through green boughs of June.

Soft and thick the snow lay,
  Stars danced in the sky.
Not all the lambs of May-day
  Skip so bold and high.

Your feet were dancing, Alice,
  Seemed to dance on air,
You looked a ghost or angel
  In the starlight there.

Your eyes were frosted starlight,
Your heart fire and snow.
Who was it said, "I love you"?

   Alice

  Mother, let me go!



A SONG FOR TWO CHILDREN.

"Make a song, father, a new little song,
   All for Jenny and Nancy."
 Balow lalow or Hey derry down,
   Or else what might you fancy?

 Is there any song sweet enough
   For Nancy and for Jenny?
  Said Simple Simon to the pieman,
   "Indeed I know not any."

"I've counted the miles to Babylon,
   I've flown the earth like a bird,
 I've ridden cock-horse to Banbury Cross,
   But no such song have I heard."

"Some speak of Alexander,
   And some of Hercules,
 But where are there any like Nancy and Jenny,
   Where are there any like these?"

  

DICKY.

   Mother

Oh, what a heavy sigh!
  Dicky, are you ailing?

   Dicky

Even by this fireside, mother,
  My heart is failing.

To-night across the down,
  Whistling and jolly,
I sauntered out from town
  With my stick of holly.

Bounteous and cool from sea
  The wind was blowing,
Cloud shadows under the moon
  Coming and going.

I sang old roaring songs,
  Ran and leaped quick,
And turned home by St. Swithin's
  Twirling my stick.

And there as I was passing
  The churchyard gate
An old man stopped me, "Dicky,
  You're walking late."

I did not know the man,
  I grew afeared
At his lean lolling jaw,
  His spreading beard.

His garments old and musty,
  Of antique cut,
His body very lean and bony,
  His eyes tight shut.

Oh, even to tell it now
  My courage ebbs...
His face was clay, mother,
  His beard, cobwebs.

In that long horrid pause
  "Good-night," he said,
Entered and clicked the gate,
  "Each to his bed."

   Mother

Do not sigh or fear, Dicky,
  How is it right
To grudge the dead their ghostly dark
  And wan moonlight?

We have the glorious sun,
  Lamp and fireside.
Grudge not the dead their moonshine
  When abroad they ride.



THE THREE DRINKERS.

Blacksmith Green had three strong sons,
  With bread and beef did fill 'em,
Now John and Ned are perished and dead,
  But plenty remains of William.

John Green was a whiskey drinker,
  The Land of Cakes supplied him,
Till at last his soul flew out by the hole
  That the fierce drink burned inside him.

Ned Green was a water drinker,
  And, Lord, how Ned would fuddle!
He rotted away his mortal clay
  Like an old boot thrown in a puddle.

Will Green was a wise young drinker,
  Shrank from whiskey or water,
But he made good cheer with headstrong beer,
  And married an alderman's daughter.



THE BOY OUT OF CHURCH.

As Jesus and his followers
  Upon a Sabbath morn
Were walking by a wheat field
  They plucked the ears of corn.

They plucked it, they rubbed it,
  They blew the husks away,
Which grieved the pious pharisees
  Upon the Sabbath day.

And Jesus said, "A riddle
  Answer if you can,
Was man made for the Sabbath
  Or Sabbath made for man?"

I do not love the Sabbath,
  The soapsuds and the starch,
The troops of solemn people
  Who to Salvation march.

I take my book, I take my stick
  On the Sabbath day,
In woody nooks and valleys
  I hide myself away.

To ponder there in quiet
  God's Universal Plan,
Resolved that church and Sabbath
  Were never made for man.



AFTER THE PLAY.

   Father

Have you spent the money I gave you to-day?

   John

  Ay, father I have.
A fourpence on cakes, two pennies that away
  To a beggar I gave.

   Father

The lake of yellow brimstone boil for you in Hell,
  Such lies that you spin.
Tell the truth now, John, ere the falsehood swell,
  Say, where have you been?

   John

I'll lie no more to you, father, what is the need?
  To the Play I went,
With sixpence for a near seat, money's worth indeed,
  The best ever spent.

Grief to you, shame or grief, here is the story--
  My splendid night!
It was colour, scents, music, a tragic glory,
  Fear with delight.

Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, title of the tale:
  He of that name,
A tall, glum fellow, velvet cloaked, with a shirt of mail,
  Two eyes like flame.

All the furies of fate circled round the man,
  Maddening his heart,
There was old murder done before play began,
  Ay, the ghost took part.

There were grave-diggers delving, they brought up bones,
  And with rage and grief
All the players shouted in full, kingly tones,
  Grand, passing belief.

Oh, there were ladies there radiant like day,
  And changing scenes:
Great sounding words were tossed about like hay
  By kings and queens.

How the plot turned about I watched in vain,
  Though for grief I cried,
As one and all they faded, poisoned or slain,
  In great agony died.

Father, you'll drive me forth never to return,
  Doubting me your son--

   Father

So I shall, John

   John

--but that glory for which I burn
  Shall be soon begun.

I shall wear great boots, shall strut and shout,
  Keep my locks curled.
The fame of my name shall go ringing about
  Over half the world.

   Father

Horror that your Prince found, John may you find,
  Ever and again
Dying before the house in such torture of mind
  As you need not feign.

While they clap and stamp at your nightly fate,
  They shall never know
The curse that drags at you, until Hell's gate.
  You have heard me.  Go!



SONG:  ONE HARD LOOK.

Small gnats that fly
In hot July
And lodge in sleeping ears,
Can rouse therein
A trumpet's din
With Day-of-Judgement fears.

Small mice at night
Can wake more fright
Than lions at midday.
An urchin small
Torments us all
Who tread his prickly way.

A straw will crack
The camel's back,
To die we need but sip,
So little sand
As fills the hand
Can stop a steaming ship.

One smile relieves
A heart that grieves
Though deadly sad it be,
And one hard look
Can close the book
That lovers love to see--



TRUE JOHNNY.

Johnny, sweetheart, can you be true
To all those famous vows you've made,
Will you love me as I love you
Until we both in earth are laid?
Or shall the old wives nod and say
His love was only for a day:
  The mood goes by,
  His fancies fly,
And Mary's left to sigh.

Mary, alas, you've hit the truth,
And I with grief can but admit
Hot-blooded haste controls my youth,
My idle fancies veer and flit
From flower to flower, from tree to tree,
And when the moment catches me,
  Oh, love goes by
  Away I fly
And leave my girl to sigh.

Could you but now foretell the day,
Johnny, when this sad thing must be,
When light and gay you'll turn away
And laugh and break the heart in me?
For like a nut for true love's sake
My empty heart shall crack and break,
  When fancies fly
  And love goes by
And Mary's left to die.

When the sun turns against the clock,
When Avon waters upward flow,
When eggs are laid by barn-door cock,
When dusty hens do strut and crow,
When up is down, when left is right,
Oh, then I'll break the troth I plight,
  With careless eye
  Away I'll fly
And Mary here shall die.



THE VOICE OF BEAUTY DROWNED.

Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
The other birds woke all around,
Rising with toot and howl they stirred
Their plumage, broke the trembling sound,
They craned their necks, they fluttered wings,
"While we are silent no one sings,
And while we sing you hush your throat,
Or tune your melody to our note."

Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
The screams and hootings rose again:
They gaped with raucous beaks, they whirred
Their noisy plumage; small but plain
The lonely hidden singer made
A well of grief within the glade.
"Whist, silly fool, be off," they shout,
"Or we'll come pluck your feathers out."

Cry from the thicket my heart's bird!
Slight and small the lovely cry
Came trickling down, but no one heard.
Parrot and cuckoo, crow, magpie
Jarred horrid notes and the jangling jay
Ripped the fine threads of song away,
For why should peeping chick aspire
To challenge their loud woodland choir?

Cried it so sweet that unseen bird?
Lovelier could no music be,
Clearer than water, soft as curd,
Fresh as the blossomed cherry tree.
How sang the others all around?
Piercing and harsh, a maddening sound,
With Pretty Poll, tuwit-tu-woo,
Peewit, caw caw, cuckoo-cuckoo.



THE GOD CALLED POETRY.

Now I begin to know at last,
These nights when I sit down to rhyme,
The form and measure of that vast
God we call Poetry, he who stoops
And leaps me through his paper hoops
A little higher every time.

Tempts me to think I'll grow a proper
Singing cricket or grass-hopper
Making prodigious jumps in air
While shaken crowds about me stare
Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder
To fly up on my master's shoulder
Rustling the thick strands of his hair.

He is older than the seas,
Older than the plains and hills,
And older than the light that spills
From the sun's hot wheel on these.
He wakes the gale that tears your trees,
He sings to you from window sills.

At you he roars, or he will coo,
He shouts and screams when hell is hot,
Riding on the shell and shot.
He smites you down, he succours you,
And where you seek him, he is not.

To-day I see he has two heads
Like Janus--calm, benignant, this;
That, grim and scowling:  his beard spreads
From chin to chin"  this god has power
Immeasurable at every hour:
He first taught lovers how to kiss,
He brings down sunshine after shower,
Thunder and hate are his also,
He is YES and he is NO.

The black beard spoke and said to me,
"Human frailty though you be,
Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!
They'll obey you in the end:
Hill and field, river and marsh
Shall obey you, hop and skip
At the terrour of your whip,
To your gales of anger bend."

The pale beard spoke and said in turn
"True:  a prize goes to the stern,
But sing and laugh and easily run
Through the wide airs of my plain,
Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,
And draw my creatures with soft song;
They shall follow you along
Graciously with no doubt or pain."

Then speaking from his double head
The glorious fearful monster said
"I am YES and I am NO,
Black as pitch and white as snow,
Love me, hate me, reconcile
Hate with love, perfect with vile,
So equal justice shall be done
And life shared between moon and sun.
Nature for you shall curse or smile:
A poet you shall be, my son."



ROCKY ACRES.

This is a wild land, country of my choice,
  With harsh craggy mountain, moor ample and bare.
Seldom in these acres is heard any voice
  But voice of cold water that runs here and there
  Through rocks and lank heather growing without care.
No mice in the heath run nor no birds cry
For fear of the dark speck that floats in the sky.

He soars and he hovers rocking on his wings,
  He scans his wide parish with a sharp eye,
He catches the trembling of small hidden things,
  He tears them in pieces, dropping from the sky:
  Tenderness and pity the land will deny,
Where life is but nourished from water and rock
A hardy adventure, full of fear and shock.

Time has never journeyed to this lost land,
  Crakeberries and heather bloom out of date,
The rocks jut, the streams flow singing on either hand,
  Careless if the season be early or late.
  The skies wander overhead, now blue, now slate:
Winter would be known by his cold cutting snow
If June did not borrow his armour also.

Yet this is my country be loved by me best,
  The first land that rose from Chaos and the Flood,
Nursing no fat valleys for comfort and rest,
  Trampled by no hard hooves, stained with no blood.
  Bold immortal country whose hill tops have stood
Strongholds for the proud gods when on earth they go,
Terror for fat burghers in far plains below.



ADVICE TO LOVERS.

I knew an old man at a Fair
Who made it his twice-yearly task
To clamber on a cider cask
And cry to all the yokels there:--

"Lovers to-day and for all time
 Preserve the meaning of my rhyme:
 Love is not kindly nor yet grim
 But does to you as you to him.

"Whistle, and Love will come to you,
 Hiss, and he fades without a word,
 Do wrong, and he great wrong will do,
 Speak, he retells what he has heard.

"Then all you lovers have good heed
 Vex not young Love in word or deed:
 Love never leaves an unpaid debt,
 He will not pardon nor forget."

The old man's voice was sweet yet loud
And this shows what a man was he,
He'd scatter apples to the crowd
And give great draughts of cider, free.



NEBUCHADNEZZAR'S FALL.

Frowning over the riddle that Daniel told,
Down through the mist hung garden, below a feeble sun,
The King of Persia walked:  oh, the chilling cold!
His mind was webbed with a grey shroud vapour-spun.

Here for the pride of his soaring eagle heart,
Here for his great hand searching the skies for food,
Here for his courtship of Heaven's high stars he shall smart,
Nebuchadnezzar shall fall, crawl, be subdued.

Hot sun struck through the vapour, leaf strewn mould
Breathed sweet decay:  old Earth called for her child.
Mist drew off from his mind, Sun scattered gold,
Warmth came and earthy motives fresh and wild.

Down on his knees he sinks, the stiff-necked King,
Stoops and kneels and grovels, chin to the mud.
Out from his changed heart flutter on startled wing
The fancy birds of his Pride, Honour, Kinglihood.

He crawls, he grunts, he is beast-like, frogs and snails
His diet, and grass, and water with hand for cup.
He herds with brutes that have hooves and horns and tails,
He roars in his anger, he scratches, he looks not up.


GIVE US RAIN.

"Give us Rain, Rain," said the bean and the pea,
  "Not so much Sun,
  Not so much Sun."
But the Sun smiles bravely and encouragingly,
And no rain falls and no waters run.

"Give us Peace, Peace," said the peoples oppressed,
  "Not so many Flags,
  Not so many Flags."
But the Flags fly and the Drums beat, denying rest,
And the children starve, they shiver in rags.



ALLIE.

Allie, call the birds in,
  The birds from the sky.
Allie calls, Allie sings,
  Down they all fly.
First there came
Two white doves
  Then a sparrow from his nest,
Then a clucking bantam hen,
  Then a robin red-breast.

Allie, call the beasts in,
  The beasts, every one.
Allie calls, Allie sings,
  In they all run.
First there came
Two black lambs,
  Then a grunting Berkshire sow,
Then a dog without a tail,
  Then a red and white cow.

Allie, call the fish up,
  The fish from the stream.
Allie calls, Allie sings,
  Up they all swim.
First there came
Two gold fish,
  A minnow and a miller's thumb,
Then a pair of loving trout,
  Then the twisted eels come.

Allie, call the children,
  Children from the green.
Allie calls, Allie sings,
  Soon they run in.
First there came
Tom and Madge,
  Kate and I who'll not forget
How we played by the water's edge
  Till the April sun set.



LOVING HENRY.

Henry, Henry, do you love me?
Do I love you, Mary?
Oh, can you mean to liken me
To the aspen tree.
Whose leaves do shake and vary,
From white to green
And back again,
Shifting and contrary?

Henry, Henry, do you love me,
Do you love me truly?
Oh, Mary, must I say again
My love's a pain,
A torment most unruly?
It tosses me
Like a ship at sea
When the storm rages fully.

Henry, Henry, why do you love me?
Mary, dear, have pity!
I swear, of all the girls there are
Both near and far,
In country or in city,
There's none like you,
So kind, so true,
So wise, so brave, so pretty.



BRITTLE BONES.

Though I am an old man
  With my bones very brittle,
Though I am a poor old man
  Worth very little,
Yet I suck at my long pipe
  At peace in the sun,
I do not fret nor much regret
  That my work is done.

If I were a young man
  With my bones full of marrow,
Oh, if I were a bold young man
  Straight as an arrow,
And if I had the same years
  To live once again,
I would not change their simple range
  Of laughter and pain.

If I were a young man
  And young was my Lily,
A smart girl, a bold young man,
  Both of us silly.
And though from time before I knew
  She'd stab me with pain,
Though well I knew she'd not be true,
  I'd love her again.

If I were a young man
  With a brisk, healthy body,
Oh, if I were a bold young man
  With love of rum toddy,
Though I knew that I was spiting
  My old age with pain,
My happy lip would touch and sip
  Again and again.

If I were a young man
  With my bones full of marrow,
Oh, if I were a bold young man
  Straight as an arrow,
I'd store up no virtue
  For Heaven's distant plain,
I'd live at ease as I did please
  And sin once again.



APPLES AND WATER.

Dust in a cloud, blinding weather,
  Drums that rattle and roar!
A mother and daughter stood together
  Beside their cottage door.

"Mother, the heavens are bright like brass,
  The dust is shaken high,
With labouring breath the soldiers pass,
  Their lips are cracked and dry."

"Mother, I'll throw them apples down,
  I'll bring them pails of water."
The mother turned with an angry frown
  Holding back her daughter.

"But mother, see, they faint with thirst,
  They march away to die,"
"Ah, sweet, had I but known at first
  Their throats are always dry."

"There is no water can supply them
  In western streams that flow,
There is no fruit can satisfy them
  On orchard trees that grow."

"Once in my youth I gave, poor fool,
  A soldier apples and water,
So may I die before you cool
  Your father's drouth, my daughter."



MANTICOR IN ARABIA.

(The manticors of the montaines
Mighte feed them on thy braines.--Skelton.)

Thick and scented daisies spread
Where with surface dull like lead
Arabian pools of slime invite
Manticors down from neighbouring height
To dip heads, to cool fiery blood
In oozy depths of sucking mud.
Sing then of ringstraked manticor,
Man-visaged tiger who of yore
Held whole Arabian waste in fee
With raging pride from sea to sea,
That every lesser tribe would fly
Those armed feet, that hooded eye;
Till preying on himself at last
Manticor dwindled, sank, was passed
By gryphon flocks he did disdain.
Ay, wyverns and rude dragons reign
In ancient keep of manticor
Agreed old foe can rise no more.
Only here from lakes of slime
Drinks manticor and bides due time:
Six times Fowl Phoenix in yon tree
Must mount his pyre and burn and be
Renewed again, till in such hour
As seventh Phoenix flames to power
And lifts young feathers, overnice
From scented pool of steamy spice
Shall manticor his sway restore
And rule Arabian plains once more.



OUTLAWS.

Owls:  they whinney down the night,
  Bats go zigzag by.
Ambushed in shadow out of sight
  The outlaws lie.

Old gods, shrunk to shadows, there
  In the wet woods they lurk,
Greedy of human stuff to snare
  In webs of murk.

Look up, else your eye must drown
  In a moving sea of black
Between the tree-tops, upside down
  Goes the sky-track.

Look up, else your feet will stray
  Towards that dim ambuscade,
Where spider-like they catch their prey
  In nets of shade.

For though creeds whirl away in dust,
  Faith fails and men forget,
These aged gods of fright and lust
  Cling to life yet.

Old gods almost dead, malign,
  Starved of their ancient dues,
Incense and fruit, fire, blood and wine
  And an unclean muse.

Banished to woods and a sickly moon,
  Shrunk to mere bogey things,
Who spoke with thunder once at noon
  To prostrate kings.

With thunder from an open sky
  To peasant, tyrant, priest,
Bowing in fear with a dazzled eye
  Towards the East.

Proud gods, humbled, sunk so low,
  Living with ghosts and ghouls,
And ghosts of ghosts and last year's snow
  And dead toadstools.



BALOO LOO FOR JENNY.

Sing baloo loo for Jenny
  And where is she gone?
Away to spy her mother's land,
  Riding all alone.

To the rich towns of Scotland,
  The woods and the streams,
High upon a Spanish horse
  Saddled for her dreams.

By Oxford and by Chester,
  To Berwick-on-the-Tweed,
Then once across the borderland
  She shall find no need.

A loaf for her at Stirling,
  A scone at Carlisle,
Honeyed cakes at Edinbro'--
  That shall make her smile.

At Aberdeen clear cider,
  Mead for her at Nairn,
A cup of wine at John o' Groats--
  That shall please my bairn.

Sing baloo loo for Jenny,
  Mother will be fain
To see her little truant child
  Riding home again.



HAWK AND BUCKLE.

Where is the landlord of old Hawk and Buckle,
And what of Master Straddler this hot summer weather?
He's along in the tap-room with broad cheeks a-chuckle,
And ten bold companions all drinking together.

Where is the daughter of old Hawk and Buckle,
And what of Mistress Jenny this hot summer weather?
She sits in the parlour with smell of honeysuckle,
Trimming her bonnet with red ostrich feather.

Where is the ostler of old Hawk and Buckle,
And what of Willy Jakeman this hot summer weather?
He is rubbing his eyes with a slow and lazy knuckle
As he wakes from his nap on a bank of fresh heather.

Where is the page boy of old Hawk and Buckle,
And what of our young Charlie this hot summer weather?
He is bobbing for tiddlers in a little trickle-truckle,
With his line and his hook and his breeches of leather.

Where is the grey goat of old Hawk and Buckle,
And what of pretty Nanny this hot summer weather?
She stays not contented with little or with muckle,
Straining for daisies at the end of her tether.

For this is our motto at old Hawk and Buckle,
We cling to it close and we sing all together,
"Every man for himself at our old Hawk and Buckle,
And devil take the hindmost this hot summer weather."



THE "ALICE JEAN".

One moonlit night a ship drove in,
  A ghost ship from the west,
Drifting with bare mast and lone tiller,
  Like a mermaid drest
In long green weed and barnacles:
  She beached and came to rest.

All the watchers of the coast
  Flocked to view the sight,
Men and women streaming down
  Through the summer night,
Found her standing tall and ragged
  Beached in the moonlight.

Then one old woman looked and wept
  "The 'Alice Jean'?  But no!
The ship that took my Dick from me
  Sixty years ago
Drifted back from the utmost west
  With the ocean's flow?

"Caught and caged in the weedy pool
  Beyond the western brink,
Where crewless vessels lie and rot
  in waters black as ink.
Torn out again by a sudden storm
  Is it the 'Jean', you think?"

A hundred women stared agape,
  The menfolk nudged and laughed,
But none could find a likelier story
  For the strange craft.
With fear and death and desolation
  Rigged fore and aft.

The blind ship came forgotten home
  To all but one of these
Of whom none dared to climb aboard her:
  And by and by the breeze
Sprang to a storm and the "Alice Jean"
  Foundered in frothy seas.

  

THE CUPBOARD.

   Mother

What's in that cupboard, Mary?

   Mary

Which cupboard, mother dear?

   Mother

The cupboard of red mahogany
  With handles shining clear.

   Mary

That cupboard, dearest mother,
  With shining crystal handles?
There's nought inside but rags and jags
  And yellow tallow candles.

   Mother

What's in that cupboard, Mary?

   Mary

Which cupboard, mother mine?

   Mother

That cupboard stands in your sunny chamber,
  The silver corners shine.

   Mary

There's nothing there inside, mother,
  But wool and thread and flax,
And bits of faded silk and velvet,
  And candles of white wax.

   Mother

What's in that cupboard, Mary?
  And this time tell me true.

   Mary

White clothes for an unborn baby, mother,
  But what's the truth to you?



THE BEACON.

The silent shepherdess,
  She of my vows,
Here with me exchanging love
  Under dim boughs.

Shines on our mysteries
  A sudden spark--
"Dout the candle, glow-worm,
  Let all be dark.

"The birds have sung their last notes,
  The Sun's to bed,
Glow-worm, dout your candle."
  The glow-worm said:

"I also am a lover;
  The lamp I display
Is beacon for my true love
  Wandering astray.

"Through the thick bushes
  And the grass comes she
With a heartload of longing
  And love for me.

"Sir, enjoy your fancy,
  But spare me harm,
A lover is a lover,
  Though but a worm."



POT AND KETTLE.

Come close to me, dear Annie, while I bind a lover's knot.
A tale of burning love between a kettle and a pot.
The pot was stalwart iron and the kettle trusty tin,
And though their sides were black with smoke they bubbled love within.

Forget that kettle, Jamie, and that pot of boiling broth,
I know a dismal story of a candle and a moth.
For while your pot is boiling and while your kettle sings
My moth makes love to candle flame and burns away his wings.

Your moth, I envy, Annie, that died by candle flame,
But here are two more lovers, unto no damage came.
There was a cuckoo loved a clock and found her always true.
For every hour they told their hearts, "Ring! ting!  Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"

As the pot boiled for the kettle, as the kettle for the pot,
So boils my love within me till my breast is glowing hot.
As the moth died for the candle, so could I die for you.
And my fond heart beats time with yours and cries, "Cuckoo!  Cuckoo!"



GHOST RADDLED.

"Come, surly fellow, come!  A song!"
  What, madmen?  Sing to you?
Choose from the clouded tales of wrong
  And terror I bring to you.

Of a night so torn with cries,
  Honest men sleeping
Start awake with glaring eyes,
  Bone-chilled, flesh creeping.

Of spirits in the web hung room
  Up above the stable,
Groans, knockings in the gloom,
  The dancing table.

Of demons in the dry well
  That cheep and mutter,
Clanging of an unseen bell,
  Blood choking the gutter.

Of lust frightful, past belief,
  Lurking unforgotten,
Unrestrainable endless grief
  From breasts long rotten.

A song?  What laughter or what song
  Can this house remember?
Do flowers and butterflies belong
  To a blind December?



NEGLECTFUL EDWARD.

   Nancy

"Edward back from the Indian Sea,
What have you brought for Nancy?"

   Edward

"A rope of pearls and a gold earring,
And a bird of the East that will not sing.
A carven tooth, a box with a key--"

   Nancy

"God be praised you are back," says she,
"Have you nothing more for your Nancy?"

   Edward

"Long as I sailed the Indian Sea
I gathered all for your fancy:
Toys and silk and jewels I bring,
And a bird of the East that will not sing:
What more can you want, dear girl, from me?"

   Nancy

"God be praised you are back," said she,
"Have you nothing better for Nancy?"

   Edward

"Safe and home from the Indian Sea,
And nothing to take your fancy?"


   Nancy

"You can keep your pearls and your gold earring,
And your bird of the East that will not sing,
But, Ned, have you nothing more for me
Than heathenish gew-gaw toys?" says she,
"Have you nothing better for Nancy?"



THE WELL-DRESSED CHILDREN.

Here's flowery taffeta for Mary's new gown:
  Here's black velvet, all the rage, for Dick's birthday coat.
Pearly buttons for you, Mary, all the way down,
  Lace ruffles, Dick, for you; you'll be a man of note.

Mary, here I've bought you a green gingham shade
  And a silk purse brocaded with roses gold and blue,
You'll learn to hold them proudly like colours on parade.
  No banker's wife in all the town half so grand as you.

I've bought for young Diccon a long walking-stick,
  Yellow gloves, well tanned, at Woodstock village made.
I'll teach you to flourish 'em and show your name is DICK,
  Strutting by your sister's side with the same parade.

On Sunday to church you go, each with a book of prayer:
  Then up the street and down the aisles, everywhere you'l
