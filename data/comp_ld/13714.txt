OF THE WORKS
OF
TALBOT MUNDY


Edited by BRADFORD M. DAY





A Bit of His Life


Talbot Mundy was born in London on April 23, 1879. He was educated at
Rugby, and served nearly ten years, beginning in 1900, as a government
official in Africa and India. While in India, he wandered all over the
sub-continent on horseback, and even into Tibet. Eastern occult lore
first attracted, then fascinated, his active and unorthodox mind. Mundy
absorbed all he could learn of the Indian beliefs.

Government service next brought him to Africa where he studied
first-hand the nature magic of many of the tribes and cultures of East
Africa. His quest for more information on this subject impelled him to
travel extensively through Egypt and the Near East and even into parts
of Arabia. This was truly adventurous at the time, but only in character
with the man who killed dozens of lions and successfully hunted for
ivory.

Mundy visited Australia, and Mexico as far south as Yucutan. He first
arrived in the United States in 1911, and liked the country so much that
he decided to stay and become a citizen.

Mundy quickly turned his energies to writing, and an article, "Pig
Sticking in India," was accepted and published in the April 1911 issue
of Adventure Magazine, itself only a few months old. Another article and
his first story, "The Phantom Battery" soon appeared. For years
thereafter, Adventure had short stories, novelettes, novels, and serials
by this master teller of tales in most of the issues that were printed.

The motif and locale of the stories and very infrequent articles usually
stemmed from the areas, people, and occult knowledge previously
mentioned. The manly art of self defense must have occupied some of
Mundy's attention during his early career. A series of stories about
Billy Blain, pugilist, appeared under the pen-name of Walter Gait,
beginning with the February 1912 issue of Adventure. Two articles were
also printed under this pseudonym.

Scribners of New York produced his first book, "Rung Ho" in 1914, then
apparently forgot him. In 1916, Bobbs-Merrill of Indianapolis published
one of his most famous stories, "King--of the Khyber Rifles," and
Cassell and Company of London brought out "The Winds of the World." Both
were well received, and Mundy's career to a moderate renown was on its
way.

In succeeding years he continued to write for Adventure and other
magazines, most of the stories being snapped up by various book
publishers. Many of the books were reprinted in several editions by
different companies, and, confusing to a bibliophile, the English
publications ware often re-titled.

During the 1920's Mundy bought a part of the Point Loma estate in
California, called The Cliffs. He settled there for several years and
became a member of the Theosophical Society presided over by Katherine
Tingley. A half-dozen of his books were written there and, "Om; the
Secret of Ahbor Valley," shows the influence of this occult society.

He contributed many articles to Tingley's theosophical magazines, her
most noted publication being the Theosophical Path. After her death in
1929, Mundy left Point Loma but always retained his interest in and
sympathy with Theosophy.

Mundy continued writing almost to the time of his death on August 5,
1940. In all, forty-nine books were produced under his name, thirty-nine
of which were original works. At least one-hundred and fifty stories and
articles appeared in magazines; most of these, perhaps nearly all, are
listed in this bibliography. None of the theosophical articles are
included here, though, as the intent of this listing is to stress his
mastery of the fantasy-high adventure tale.

It is still too soon to properly evaluate Mundy's importance in the
stream of literature. His style of writing, choice of language, is
smoothly readable. One "fault," if such it be, is a sometimes too
carefully contrived buildup to plot situations. This careful skill did
result in glowing word-pictures and living characters.

Considerable assistance was given on this project by friends and fellow
enthusiasts. My grateful thanks to all as they come to mind:


Dr. J. Lloyd Eaton--Berkeley, California
John C. Nitka--Richmond Hill, New York
James A. Strand--Portland, Oregon
Walter A. Carrithers, Jr.--Fresno, California
Robert Resch--Reading, Pennsylvania
Richard Witter, Donald Grant, and some others
for appreciated words of caution and advice.

The following list must not be supposed the final and
authoritative word on this subject.

Is this an imaginary book?
THE MAN FROM JUPITER

    Claims have been advanced that Mundy wrote this work of science
    fiction. Doubtlessly most of the imaginative creation connected with
    this book is in the minds of the gulls who pass the name of this
    title along.
