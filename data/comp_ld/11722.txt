PREFACE


It is evident, that to secure a complete system of teaching Geography in
our Schools, there should be at least three grades of Text-books; namely,
INTRODUCTORY, INTERMEDIATE, and ADVANCED. As the necessity for a Geography
more introductory in its character than those now in use has been
long felt, the Author would respectfully solicit the notice of his
fellow-teachers to this little work.

Its plan is such, that the subject is presented in the most simple form.

It treats of GENERAL FEATURES, such as the locality and description of
Continents, Countries, States, Rivers, Mountains, &c., without dwelling
prematurely upon the minute details that embarrass the learner in his first
effort.

The EXERCISES are arranged in Question and Answer.

The MAPS are free from all meridians, parallels of latitude, and any
superabundance of names; thereby giving a greater prominence to the general
divisions of land and water.
