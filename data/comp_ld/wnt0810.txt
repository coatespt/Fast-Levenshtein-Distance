Book 47 2 Corinthians
001:001 Paul, an Apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God--
        and our brother Timothy:  To the Church of God in Corinth,
        with all God's people throughout Greece.
001:002 May grace and peace be granted to you from God our Father
        and the Lord Jesus Christ.
001:003 Heartfelt thanks be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ--
        the Father who is full of compassion and the God who
        gives all comfort.
001:004 He comforts us in our every affliction so that we may be able
        to comfort those who are in any kind of affliction by means
        of the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
001:005 For just as we have more than our share of suffering for
        the Christ, so also through the Christ we have more than our
        share of comfort.
001:006 But if, on the one hand, we are enduring affliction, it is
        for your comfort and salvation; and if, on the other hand,
        we are receiving comfort, it is for your comfort which is
        produced within you through your patient fortitude under
        the same sufferings as those which we also are enduring.
001:007 And our hope for you is stedfast; for we know that as you are
        partners with us in the sufferings, so you are also partners
        in the comfort.
001:008 For as for our troubles which came upon us in the province of Asia,
        we would have you know, brethren, that we were exceedingly
        weighed down, and felt overwhelmed, so that we renounced
        all hope even of life.
001:009 Nay, we had, as we still have, the sentence of death within
        our own selves, in order that our confidence may repose,
        not on ourselves, but on God who raised the dead to life.
001:010 He it is who rescued us from so imminent a death, and will
        do so again; and we have a firm hope in Him that He will
        also rescue us in all the future,
001:011 while you on your part lend us your aid in entreaty for us,
        so that from many lips thanksgivings may rise on our behalf
        for the boon granted to us at the intercession of many.
001:012 For the reason for our boasting is this--the testimony of our own
        conscience that it was in holiness and with pure motives before God,
        and in reliance not on worldly wisdom but on the gracious
        help of God, that we have conducted ourselves in the world,
        and above all in our relations with you.
001:013 For we are writing to you nothing different from what we have
        written before, or from what indeed you already recognize
        as truth and will, I trust, recognize as such to the very end;
001:014 just as some few of you have recognized us as your reason
        for boasting, even as you will be ours, on the day of
        Jesus our Lord.
001:015 It was because I entertained this confidence that I intended
        to visit you before going elsewhere--so that you might receive
        a twofold proof of God's favour--
001:016 and to pass by way of Corinth into Macedonia.  Then my plan
        was to return from Macedonia to you, and be helped forward
        by you to Judaea.
001:017 Did I display any vacillation or caprice in this?
        Or the purposes which I form--do I form them on worldly principles,
        now crying "Yes, yes," and now "No, no"?
001:018 As certainly as God is faithful, our language to you is not now "Yes"
        and now "No."
001:019 For Jesus Christ the Son of God--He who was proclaimed
        among you by us, that is by Silas and Timothy and myself--
        did not show Himself a waverer between "Yes" and "No."
        But it was and always is "Yes" with Him.
001:020 For all the promises of God, whatever their number, have their
        confirmation in Him; and for this reason through Him also our "Amen"
        acknowledges their truth and promotes the glory of God
        through our faith.
001:021 But He who is making us as well as you stedfast through union
        with the Anointed One, and has anointed us, is God,
001:022 and He has also set His seal upon us, and has put His Spirit
        into our hearts as a pledge and foretaste of future blessing.
001:023 But as for me, as my soul shall answer for it, I appeal to God
        as my witness, that it was to spare you pain that I gave up
        my visit to Corinth.
001:024 Not that we want to lord it over you in respect of your faith--
        we do, however, desire to help your joy--for in the matter
        of your faith you are standing firm.
002:001 But, so far as I am concerned, I have resolved not to have
        a painful visit the next time I come to see you.
002:002 For if I of all men give you pain, who then is there to gladden
        my heart, but the very persons to whom I give pain?
002:003 And I write this to you in order that when I come I may
        not receive pain from those who ought to give me joy,
        confident as I am as to all of you that my joy is the joy
        of you all.
002:004 For with many tears I write to you, and in deep suffering
        and depression of spirit, not in order to grieve you,
        but in the hope of showing you how brimful my heart is with
        love for you.
002:005 Now if any one has caused sorrow, it has been caused not so much
        to me, as in some degree--for I have no wish to exaggerate--
        to all of you.
002:006 In the case of such a person the punishment which was inflicted
        by the majority of you is enough.
002:007 So that you may now take the opposite course, and forgive him
        rather and comfort him, for fear he should perhaps be driven
        to despair by his excess of grief.
002:008 I beg you therefore fully to reinstate him in your love.
002:009 For in writing to you I have also this object in view--
        to discover by experience whether you are prepared to be
        obedient in every respect.
002:010 When you forgive a man an offence I also forgive it;
        for in fact what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything,
        has always been for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
002:011 for fear Satan should gain an advantage over us.
        For we are not ignorant of his devices.
002:012 Now when I came into the Troad to spread there the Good News
        about the Christ, even though in the Lord's providence a door
        stood open before me,
002:013 yet, obtaining no relief for my spirit because I did not find our
        brother Titus, I bade them farewell and went on into Macedonia.
002:014 But to God be the thanks who in Christ ever heads our
        triumphal procession, and by our hands waves in every place
        that sweet incense, the knowledge of Him.
002:015 For we are a fragrance of Christ grateful to God in those whom
        He is saving and in those who are perishing;
002:016 to the last-named an odor of death predictive of death,
        and to the others an odor of life predictive of life.
        And for such service as this who is competent?
002:017 We are; for, unlike most teachers, we are not fraudulent
        hucksters of God's Message; but with transparent motives,
        as commissioned by God, in God's presence and in communion
        with Christ, so we speak.
003:001 Do you say that this is self-recommendation once more?
        Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you
        or from you?
003:002 Our letter of recommendation is yourselves--a letter written
        on our hearts and everywhere known and read.
003:003 For all can see that you are a letter of Christ entrusted
        to our care, and written not with ink, but with the Spirit
        of the ever-living God--and not on tablets of stone,
        but on human hearts as tablets.
003:004 Such is the confidence which we have through Christ in the
        presence of God;
003:005 not that of ourselves we are competent to decide anything
        by our own reasonings, but our competency comes from God.
003:006 It is He also who has made us competent to serve Him in connexion
        with a new Covenant, which is not a written code but a Spirit;
        for the written code inflicts death, but the Spirit gives Life.
003:007 If, however, the service that proclaims death--its code
        being engraved in writing upon stones--came with glory,
        so that the children of Israel could not look steadily
        on the face of Moses because of the brightness of his face--
        a vanishing brightness;
003:008 will not the service of the Spirit be far more glorious?
003:009 For if the service which pronounces doom had glory, far more
        glorious still is the service which tells of righteousness.
003:010 For, in fact, that which was once resplendent in glory has no
        glory at all in this respect, that it pales before the glory
        which surpasses it.
003:011 For if that which was to be abolished came with glory,
        much more is that which is permanent arrayed in glory.
003:012 Therefore, cherishing a hope like this, we speak without reserve,
        and we do not imitate Moses,
003:013 who used to throw a veil over his face to hide from the gaze
        of the children of Israel the passing away of what
        was but transitory.
003:014 Nay, their minds were made dull; for to this very day during
        the reading of the book of the ancient Covenant, the same
        veil remains unlifted, because it is only in Christ that it
        is to be abolished.
003:015 Yes, to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies
        upon their hearts.
003:016 But whenever the heart of the nation shall have returned
        to the Lord, the veil will be withdrawn.
003:017 Now by "the Lord" is meant the Spirit; and where the Spirit
        of the Lord is, freedom is enjoyed.
003:018 And all of us, with unveiled faces, reflecting like bright
        mirrors the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into
        the same likeness, from one degree of radiant holiness to another,
        even as derived from the Lord the Spirit.
004:001 Therefore, being engaged in this service and being mindful
        of the mercy which has been shown us, we are not cowards.
004:002 Nay, we have renounced the secrecy which marks a feeling of shame.
        We practice no cunning tricks, nor do we adulterate God's Message.
        But by a full clear statement of the truth we strive to commend
        ourselves in the presence of God to every human conscience.
004:003 If, however, the meaning of our Good News has been veiled,
        the veil has been on the hearts of those who are on the
        way to perdition,
004:004 in whom the god of this present age has blinded their unbelieving
        minds so as to shut out the sunshine of the Good News
        of the glory of the Christ, who is the image of God.
004:005 (For we do not proclaim ourselves, but we proclaim Christ Jesus
        as Lord, and ourselves as your bondservants for the sake of Jesus.)
004:006 For God who said, "Out of darkness let light shine," is He who
        has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge
        of God's glory, which is radiant on the face of Christ.
004:007 But we have this treasure in a fragile vase of clay, in order
        that the surpassing greatness of the power may be seen
        to belong to God, and not to originate in us.
004:008 We are hard pressed, yet never in absolute distress;
        perplexed, yet never utterly baffled;
004:009 pursued, yet never left unsuccoured; struck to the ground,
        yet never slain;
004:010 always, wherever we go, carrying with us in our bodies
        the putting to death of Jesus, so that in our bodies it may
        also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.
004:011 For we, alive though we are, are continually surrendering
        ourselves to death for the sake of Jesus, so that in this mortal
        nature of ours it may also be clearly shown that Jesus lives.
004:012 Thus we are constantly dying, while you are in full
        enjoyment of Life.
004:013 But possessing the same Spirit of faith as he who wrote,
        "I believed, and therefore I have spoken," we also believe,
        and therefore we speak.
004:014 For we know that He who raised the Lord Jesus from the dead
        will raise us also to be with Jesus, and will cause both us
        and you to stand in His own presence.
004:015 For everything is for your sakes, in order that grace,
        being more richly bestowed because of the thanksgivings of the
        increased number, may more and more promote the glory of God.
004:016 Therefore we are not cowards.  Nay, even though our outward
        man is wasting away, yet our inward man is being renewed
        day by day.
004:017 For this our light and transitory burden of suffering is
        achieving for us a preponderating, yes, a vastly preponderating,
        and eternal weight of glory;
004:018 while we look not at things seen, but things unseen;
        for things seen are temporary, but things unseen are eternal.
005:001 For we know that if this poor tent, our earthly house,
        is taken down, we have in Heaven a building which God has provided,
        a house not built by human hands, but eternal.
005:002 For in this one we sigh, because we long to put on over it
        our dwelling which comes from Heaven--
005:003 if indeed having really put on a robe we shall not be found
        to be unclothed.
005:004 Yes, we who are in this tent certainly do sigh under our burdens,
        for we do not wish to lay aside that with which we are
        now clothed, but to put on more, so that our mortality may
        be absorbed in Life.
005:005 And He who formed us with this very end in view is God, who has
        given us His Spirit as a pledge and foretaste of that bliss.
005:006 We have therefore a cheerful confidence.  We know that while we
        are at home in the body we are banished from the Lord;
005:007 for we are living a life of faith, and not one of sight.
005:008 So we have a cheerful confidence, and we anticipate with
        greater delight being banished from the body and going home
        to the Lord.
005:009 And for this reason also we make it our ambition, whether at
        home or in exile, to please Him perfectly.
005:010 For we must all of us appear before Christ's judgement-seat
        in our true characters, in order that each may then receive
        an award for his actions in this life, in accordance with what
        he has done, whether it be good or whether it be worthless.
005:011 Therefore, because we realize how greatly the Lord is to be feared,
        we are endeavouring to win men over, and God recognizes
        what our motives are, and I hope that you, in your hearts,
        recognize them too.
005:012 We are not again commending ourselves to your favour,
        but are furnishing you with a ground of boasting on our behalf,
        so that you may have a reply ready for those with whom
        superficial appearances are everything and sincerity of heart
        counts for nothing.
005:013 For if we have been beside ourselves, it has been for God's glory;
        or if we are now in our right senses, it is in order to be
        of service to you.
005:014 For the love of Christ overmasters us, the conclusion at which
        we have arrived being this--that One having died for all,
        His death was their death,
005:015 and that He died for all in order that the living may no longer
        live to themselves, but to Him who died for them and rose again.
005:016 Therefore for the future we know no one simply as a man.
        Even if we have known Christ as a man, yet now we do so no longer.
005:017 So that if any one is in Christ, he is a new creature:
        the old state of things has passed away; a new state of things
        has come into existence.
005:018 And all this is from God, who has reconciled us to Himself
        through Christ, and has appointed us to serve in the
        ministry of reconciliation.
005:019 We are to tell how God was in Christ reconciling the world
        to Himself, not charging men's transgressions to their account,
        and that He has entrusted to us the Message of this reconciliation.
005:020 On Christ's behalf therefore we come as ambassadors, God, as it were,
        making entreaty through our lips:  we, on Christ's behalf,
        beseech men to be reconciled to God.
005:021 He has made Him who knew nothing of sin to be sin for us,
        in order that in Him we may become the righteousness of God.
006:001 And you also we, as God's fellow workers, entreat not to be
        found to have received His grace to no purpose.
006:002 For He says, "At a time of welcome I have listened to you,
        and on a day of salvation I have succoured you."
        Now is the time of loving welcome!  Now is the day of salvation!
006:003 We endeavour to give people no cause for stumbling in anything,
        lest the work we are doing should fall into discredit.
006:004 On the contrary, as God's servants, we seek their full approval--
        by unwearied endurance, by afflictions, by distress, by helplessness;
006:005 by floggings, by imprisonments; by facing riots, by toil,
        by sleepless watching, by hunger and thirst;
006:006 by purity of life, by knowledge, by patience, by kindness,
        by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love;
006:007 by the proclamation of the truth, by the power of God;
        by the weapons of righteousness, wielded in both hands;
006:008 through honour and ignominy, through calumny and praise.
        We are looked upon as impostors and yet are true men;
006:009 as obscure persons, and yet are well known; as on the point of death,
        and yet, strange to tell, we live; as under God's discipline,
        and yet we are not deprived of life;
006:010 as sad, but we are always joyful; as poor, but we bestow
        wealth on many; as having nothing, and yet we securely
        possess all things.
006:011 O Corinthians, our lips are unsealed to you:
        our heart is expanded.
006:012 There is no narrowness in our love to you:  the narrowness
        is in your own feelings.
006:013 And in just requital--I speak as to my children--let your
        hearts expand also.
006:014 Do not come into close association with unbelievers,
        like oxen yoked with asses.  For what is there in common
        between righteousness and lawlessness?  Or what partnership
        has light with darkness?
006:015 Where can harmony between Christ and Belial be found?
        Or what participation has a believer with an unbeliever?
006:016 And what compact has the Temple of God with idols?
        For *we* are the Temple of the ever-living God; as God has said,
        "I will dwell among them, and walk about among them;
        and will be their God, and it is they who shall be My people."
006:017 Therefore, "`Come out from among them and separate yourselves,'
        says the Lord, `and touch nothing impure; and I will receive you,
        and will be a Father to you,
006:018 and you shall be My sons and daughters,' says the Lord
        the Ruler of all."
007:001 Having therefore these promises, beloved friends, let us
        purify ourselves from all defilement of body and of spirit,
        and secure perfect holiness through the fear of God.
007:002 Make room for us in your hearts.  There is not one of you
        whom we have wronged, not one to whom we have done harm,
        not one over whom we have gained any selfish advantage.
007:003 I do not say this to imply blame, for, as I have already said,
        you have such a place in our hearts that we would die with you
        or live with you.
007:004 I have great confidence in you:  very loudly do I boast of you.
        I am filled with comfort:  my heart overflows with joy amid
        all our affliction.
007:005 For even after our arrival in Macedonia we could get no relief
        such as human nature craves.  We were greatly harassed;
        there were conflicts without and fears within.
007:006 But He who comforts the depressed--even God--comforted us
        by the coming of Titus, and not by his coming only,
007:007 but also by the fact that he had felt comforted on your account,
        and by the report which he brought of your eager affection,
        of your grief, and of your jealousy on my behalf, so that I
        rejoiced more than ever.
007:008 For if I gave you pain by that letter, I do not regret it,
        though I did regret it then.  I see that that letter,
        even though for a time it gave you pain, had a salutary effect.
007:009 Now I rejoice, not in your grief, but because the grief
        led to repentance; for you sorrowed with a godly sorrow,
        which prevented you from receiving injury from us in any respect.
007:010 For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation,
        a repentance not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world
        finally produces death.
007:011 For mark the effects of this very thing--your having sorrowed
        with a godly sorrow--what earnestness it has called forth in you,
        what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what alarm,
        what longing affection, what jealousy, what meting out of justice!
        You have completely wiped away reproach from yourselves
        in the matter.
007:012 Therefore, though I wrote to you, it was not to punish the offender,
        nor to secure justice for him who had suffered the wrong,
        but it was chiefly in order that your earnest feeling on our
        behalf might become manifest to yourselves in the sight of God.
007:013 For this reason we feel comforted; and--in addition to this
        our comfort--we have been filled with all the deeper joy
        at Titus's joy, because his spirit has been set at rest
        by you all.
007:014 For however I may have boasted to him about you, I have no
        reason to feel ashamed; but as we have in all respects spoken
        the truth to you, so also our boasting to Titus about you
        has turned out to be the truth.
007:015 And his strong and tender affection is all the more drawn
        out towards you when he recalls to mind the obedience which
        all of you manifested by the timidity and nervous anxiety
        with which you welcomed him.
007:016 I rejoice that I have absolute confidence in you.
008:001 But we desire to let you know, brethren, of the grace of God
        which has been bestowed on the Churches of Macedonia;
008:002 how, while passing through great trouble, their boundless
        joy even amid their deep poverty has overflowed to increase
        their generous liberality.
008:003 For I can testify that to the utmost of their power,
        and even beyond their power, they have of their own free
        will given help.
008:004 With earnest entreaty they begged from us the favour of
        being allowed to share in the service now being rendered
        to God's people.
008:005 They not only did this, as we had expected, but first of all in
        obedience to God's will they gave their own selves to the Lord
        and to us.
008:006 This led us to urge Titus that, as he had previously been
        the one who commenced the work, so he should now go and complete
        among you this act of beneficence also.
008:007 Yes, just as you are already very rich in faith, readiness of speech,
        knowledge, unwearied zeal, and in the love that is in you,
        implanted by us, see to it that this grace of liberal giving
        also flourishes in you.
008:008 I am not saying this by way of command, but to test by the standard
        of other men's earnestness the genuineness of your love also.
008:009 For you know the condescending goodness of our Lord Jesus Christ--
        how for your sakes He became poor, though He was rich,
        in order that you through His poverty might grow rich.
008:010 But in this matter I give you an opinion; for my doing this helps
        forward your own intentions, seeing that not only have you
        begun operations, but a year ago you already had the desire
        to do so.
008:011 And now complete the doing also, in order that, just as there
        was then the eagerness in desiring, there may now be
        the accomplishment in proportion to your means.
008:012 For, assuming the earnest willingness, the gift is acceptable
        according to whatever a man has, and not according to what
        he has not.
008:013 I do not urge you to give in order that others may have relief
        while you are unduly pressed,
008:014 but that, by equalization of burdens, your superfluity
        having in the present emergency supplied their deficiency,
        their superfluity may in turn be a supply for your deficiency
        later on, so that there may be equalization of burdens.
008:015 Even as it is written, "He who gathered much had not too much,
        and he who gathered little had not too little."
008:016 But thanks be to God that He inspires the heart of Titus
        with the same deep interest in you;
008:017 for Titus welcomed our request, and, being thoroughly in earnest,
        comes to you of his own free will.
008:018 And we send with him the brother whose praises for his
        earnestness in proclaiming the Good News are heard throughout
        all the Churches.
008:019 And more than that, he is the one who was chosen by the vote
        of the Churches to travel with us, sharing our commission
        in the administration of this generous gift to promote
        the Lord's glory and gratify our own strong desire.
008:020 For against one thing we are on our guard--I mean against blame
        being thrown upon us in respect to these large and liberal
        contributions which are under our charge.
008:021 For we seek not only God's approval of our integrity,
        but man's also.
008:022 And we send with them our brother, of whose zeal we have had
        frequent proof in many matters, and who is now more zealous
        than ever through the strong confidence which he has in you.
008:023 As for Titus, remember that he is a partner with me, and is
        my comrade in my labours for you.  And as for our brethren,
        remember that they are delegates from the Churches, and are
        men in whom Christ is glorified.
008:024 Exhibit therefore to the Churches a proof of your love,
        and a justification of our boasting to these brethren about you.
009:001 As to the services which are being rendered to God's people,
        it is really unnecessary for me to write to you.
009:002 For I know your earnest willingness, on account of which I
        habitually boast of you to the Macedonians, pointing out
        to them that for a whole year you in Greece have been ready;
        and the greater number of them have been spurred on
        by your ardour.
009:003 Still I send the brethren in order that in this matter our
        boast about you may not turn out to have been an idle one;
        so that, as I have said, you may be ready;
009:004 for fear that, if any Macedonians come with me and find
        you unprepared, we--not to say you yourselves--should be put
        to the blush in respect to this confidence.
009:005 I have thought it absolutely necessary therefore to request
        these brethren to visit you before I myself come, and to make
        sure beforehand that the gift of love which you have already
        promised may be ready as a gift of love, and may not seem
        to have been something which I have extorted from you.
009:006 But do not forget that he who sows with a niggardly hand will
        also reap a niggardly crop, and that he who sows bountifully
        will also reap bountifully.
009:007 Let each contribute what he has decided upon in his own mind,
        and not do it reluctantly or under compulsion.
        "It is a cheerful giver that God loves."
009:008 And God is able to bestow every blessing on you in abundance,
        so that richly enjoying all sufficiency at all times,
        you may have ample means for all good works.
009:009 As it is written, "He has scattered abroad, he has given
        to the poor, his almsgiving remains for ever."
009:010 And God who continually supplies seed for the sower and bread
        for eating, will supply you with seed and multiply it,
        and will cause your almsgiving to yield a plentiful harvest.
009:011 May you be abundantly enriched so as to show all liberality,
        such as through our instrumentality brings thanksgiving to God.
009:012 For the service rendered in this sacred gift not only helps
        to relieve the wants of God's people, but it is also rich
        in its results and awakens a chorus of thanksgiving to God.
009:013 For, by the practical proof of it which you exhibit in
        this service, you cause God to be extolled for your fidelity
        to your professed adherence to the Good News of the Christ,
        and for the liberality of your contributions for them and
        for all who are in need,
009:014 while they themselves also in supplications on your behalf
        pour out their longing love towards you because of God's
        surpassing grace which is resting upon you.
009:015 Thanks be to God for H
