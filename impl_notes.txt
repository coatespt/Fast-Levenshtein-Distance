This document contains implementation note for the Fast Levenshtein Estimate tool.
It is an opensource project and is available on Github without charge.

The program has a simple command-line interface (CLI) that is intended to run on the
Unix or Linux command line in the standard Unix pipeline style. The program reads its
CSV input from a file or from standard input (stdin) and writes its output to stdin,
also as lines of CSV.

There is no graphical interface.

The program is written entirely in Java 11 and compiled using Maven 3.6.3 using OpenJDK 64-Bit Java
version: 11.0.11. Development was done on the PopOS version of Ubuntu, "linux" version:
"5.11.0-7620-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix".

That said, the source code is generic Java using no advanced features, and should
be forgiving about attempts to compile under earlier Java versions. As a Java program, the
jar file that results from building should run any operating system that supports the
appropriate Java JRE.

The project can be cloned using git@github.com:coatespt/Fast-Levenshtein-Distance.git
and can be built on the command line using Maven mvn or in any Java IDE such as
Eclipse or Intellij Idea. See details for downloading, building, and running in the file
manual.txt
