This is a git project that demonstrates a heuristic for making very fast estimates of
Levenshtein Distance (LD) of large text files from signatures.

The most important element of the project is a command-line-interface (CLI) tool
that (1) creates a target CSV files of signatures (2) allows the user to specify a
set of input files for which signatures will be created and matched to the set
of targets.

The file manual.txt contains detailed instructions for downloading, building, and using
this tool via the CLI.

The file impl_notes.txt contains information about the programming language, development
environment, versions, etc.
